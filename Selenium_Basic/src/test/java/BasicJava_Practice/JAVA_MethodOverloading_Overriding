> Method Overloading

class OverloadingExample{    
static int add(int a,int b)
 {
   return a+b;
 }    
static int add(int a,int b,int c)
 {
   return a+b+c;
 }    
}    

allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, provided their parameter lists are different.

> Method Overriding

class Animal
{    
 void eat()
  {
     System.out.println("eating...");
  }    
}    
class Dog extends Animal 
{    
 void eat()
  {
    System.out.println("eating bread...");
  }    
}   

allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
It enables a subclass to inherit the method from the superclass but override it to perform a different task.
