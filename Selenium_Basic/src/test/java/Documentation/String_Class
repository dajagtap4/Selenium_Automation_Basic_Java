All about String 

 built-in class

String s1 = "Hello";                // String literal, // stored in the string pool
String s2 = new String("Hello");    // creates a new String object in the heap memory, bypassing the string pool.

Strings created using literals are stored in the string pool, which is a special memory area in the heap. 
If another string with the same content already exists in the pool, the new reference points to the existing string.

The new keyword explicitly creates a new String object in the heap memory, bypassing the string pool.
