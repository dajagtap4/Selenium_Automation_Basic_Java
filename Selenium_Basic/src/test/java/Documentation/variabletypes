local variable -
A variable declared inside method is called local variable. 
You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods 
in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.


instance variable -
A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, 
is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.

It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific 
and is not shared among instances.


static variable -
A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. 
It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable 
and share it among all the instances of the class.
 
Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when
class is loaded in the memory.
