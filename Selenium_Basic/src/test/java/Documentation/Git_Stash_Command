Git Stash 

Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part 
of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work. 
Git stashing allows you to do so. The git stash command enables you to switch branches 
without committing the current branch.

Git stash 
	the directory is cleaned, 
	you can switch between branches and work on them.

Git stash save "reverse string code" 
	save with message.

Git stash list 
	To check the stored stashes
	
Git stash apply
	You can re-apply the changes that you just stashed by using the 'git stash' command.
	'GIt stash pop' is similar but pop will delete stash from stack.
	
git stash apply stash@{1}
	re-apply the changes at 1 index order
	
Git stash show
	We can track the stashes and their changes
	
git stash show -p 
	partial stash show
	
Git stash pop
	It removes changes from stash & applies to working file.
	'GIt stash apply' is similar but pop will delete stash from stack.
	
Git stash drop  
git stash drop stash@{1}  
	it deletes the most recent stash.
	
Git stash clear
	deleting all the available stashes at once.
	
Git stash branch
	If you stashed some work on a particular branch and continue working on that branch. 
	Then, it may create a conflict during merging. So, it is good to stash work 
	on a separate branch.

	The 'git stash branch' command allows the user to stash work on a separate branch 
	to avoid conflicts.
